One of his ancestors was Mr Speaker Thorpe of Edward II's Parliament, who was beheaded by a mob in 1461.\n\nHe was sent to a school in Connecticut in 1940 to escape the Blitz.\n\nOne historian has suggested that the liberal regime at his American school played a large part in formulating his political thinking and was, no doubt, a huge contrast to Eton where he went from 1943.\n\nHe read law at Trinity College, Oxford where he cut a dash, both by wearing Edwardian-style clothes and as a noted debater. He became chairman of the Liberal Club and then the Oxford Union.\n\nWhile training as a barrister he set out to find a parliamentary seat and was selected for Conservative-held North Devon, firmly in the west country Liberal heartland.\n\nHis energetic campaigning, and inspiring performances as an orator saw him halve the Conservative majority in the 1955 general election.\n\nJust four years later, he won the seat by the narrowest of margins, a rare Liberal triumph in what had been a poor election showing for the party elsewhere in the country.\n\nHe entered the 1960s as a pioneering campaigner for human rights, attacking South Africa's policy of apartheid and the post-colonial excesses in South East Asia.\n\nHe also achieved a reputation as something of a wit exemplified by his observation on Harold Macmillan's dismissal of a third of the Conservative cabinet in 1962.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this,\" quipped Thorpe, \"that he lay down his friends for his life\".\n\nHe became a favourite at Liberal party conferences and served as the party's treasurer before being elected leader in 1967 promising to turn the Liberals into a radical pioneering force.\n\nHowever Edward Heath's win in the 1970 general election dashed hopes of a Liberal revival and shortly after it Thorpe's young wife Caroline was killed in a car crash.\n\nThree years later he married Marion Stein, a noted concert pianist and the divorced wife of the Queen's first cousin, the Earl of Harewood.\n\nHelped by Thorpe's elegant appearance and charismatic style, the Liberals won 14 seats in the February 1974 election.\n\nWith a hung parliament, Conservative leader, Edward Heath, approached Thorpe to discuss a possible coalition.\n\nThorpe was attracted by the offer of a seat in Cabinet, but met opposition from his own MPs.\n\nIn the event, Harold Wilson's clear victory in the October 1974 election ended any hopes that the Liberals might have a share of power.\n\nWithin two years, stories were circulating about Thorpe's relationship with a former male model, Norman Scott.\n\nIt was made worse because the relationship was alleged to have started in 1961, when male homosexual acts were illegal.\n\nThe story broke when Scott was appearing at a court in Barnstaple on a minor social security charge.\n\nDuring the hearing, Scott shouted out, \"I am being hounded because of my sexual relationship with Jeremy Thorpe.\" He gave a statement to the police but no action was taken.\n\nThorpe issued an immediate denial but when an affectionate letter between them appeared in the press, Thorpe resigned as leader.\n\nBut worse was to come. Eighteen months later, a man called Andrew Newton was released from prison.\n\nHe had been jailed on charges arising from an incident on Exmoor in which Norman Scott's dog, Rinka, was shot.\n\nHe claimed that he had been paid by a leading Liberal supporter to kill Scott because of his blackmail threats but said he had lost his nerve and shot the dog instead.\n\nNine more months of police investigation led to Thorpe and three associates being charged with conspiring to murder Scott.\n\nThe 1979 trial was postponed for eight days at Thorpe's request so that he could contest his North Devon seat in the May general election. He was heavily defeated.\n\nThe trial attracted reporters from all over the world. It took 20 days for the prosecution to present its case to the jury while defence evidence occupied just a single day.\n\nOn the advice of his barrister, George Carman QC, Thorpe and his co-defendants elected not to go into the witness box.\n\nEventually, after six weeks, the charges were dismissed. For two years Jeremy Thorpe stayed out of the public eye.\n\nBut the affair resurfaced again when one of his co-defendants, David Holmes, a former deputy treasurer of the Liberal Party, wrote a series of articles for the News of the World newspaper.\n\nIn the first of them he claimed that Thorpe did incite him to murder Norman Scott. Thorpe's solicitor immediately issued a rebuttal and the director of public prosecutions said there was no question of another trial.\n\nShortly after his acquittal he was offered the post of director general of the British section of Amnesty International.\n\nHe had previously been a valuable source of information to the organisation, particularly on the subject of human rights abuses in Ghana.\n\nBut there was huge opposition from Amnesty's members and the appointment was never made.\n\nHis later years saw the onset of Parkinson's Disease. But he kept in close touch with the Westminster he loved, despite painful memories.\n\nHe became the President of the North Devon Liberal Association, later Liberal Democrat Association, and received a standing ovation when he appeared at the 1997 Liberal Democrat conference.\n\nIn an interview in 2009 the ailing former politician reflected on the events that had brought him down\n\n\"If it happened now,\" he said, \" I think the public would be kinder.\"", "created_at": 1417726977.198999, "updated_at": 1418512012.965497, "image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73263000/jpg/_73263199_64261646.jpg", "feed_id": 73, "id": 75231, "source_id": 6}, {"url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663829/s/412014a0/sc/6/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cuk0Enews0C20A140Cdec0C0A40Cjeremy0Ethorpe0Eformer0Eliberal0Eparty0Eleader0Edies0Eaged0E85/story01.htm", "html": null, "title": "Jeremy Thorpe, former Liberal party leader, dies aged 85", "text": "Jeremy Thorpe, who brought the Liberal party to the brink of coalition government in 1974 but resigned amid scandal soon after, has died aged 85. He died on Thursday morning after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, his son Rupert has announced.\n\nFrom the age of 38, he led the Liberals for nine years. Between 1967 and 1976, surviving a poor performance in the 1970 general election, he turned the Liberals from a tiny party of six MPs into a small one of 11. In the 1974 general election, Thorpe played up his relative youthfulness by vaulting a security barrier wearing his trademark trilby.\n\nThe Liberals made a breakthrough, winning 19% of the vote (then a post-war record) and got 14 MPs. Although Ted Heath had not won a majority, he had won the popular vote and refused to resign. Thorpe went to Downing Street for secret coalition talks with Heath (at one point being smuggled into No 10).\n\nThe talks eventually collapsed as the Liberals couldn't stomach coalition with the Tories and feared being tainted by Heath, whom even the Spectator was calling a \"squatter\" in No 10. It was the the closest to actual government the third party had come for decades , with the failure of the talks leading to a minority Labour government led by Harold Wilson.\n\nTwo years after walking up Downing Street, Thorpe resigned as leader of the party after being accused of conspiracy to murder a former model, Norman Scott, who claimed to be a former lover. Scott had been out walking his great Dane, Rinka, and, though he survived, the animal was killed. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges in 1979, but had by then had lost his seat and his party.\n\nNot long after the end of the trial Thorpe was found to have Parkinson's disease and retired from public life. For many years, the disease has been at an advanced stage. However, in 1997 he visited the Liberal Democrat party conference and was given a standing ovation by party members, and he attended the funeral of Roy Jenkins in 2003.\n\nIn 1999, Thorpe published his memoirs, In My Own Time, in which he described key episodes in his political life. He did not, however, shed any further light on the Norman Scott affair.\n\n\"If it happened now I think ... the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it,\" he told the Guardian in 2008. \"It offended their set of values.\"\n\nHarold Wilson thought the allegations a Conservative smear, asking in a memo to one of his ministers, Barbara Castle, why damaging details surfaced later in the 1970s at a time when Labour might want to go into coalition with the Liberals, rather than earlier when Heath wanted them.\n\nHe said in 2008 that it was more likely to have been his opposition to apartheid that brought about the trouble: \"South Africa certainly attempted to smear me. They made life very difficult. I wanted to clear the air, but I was pretty shattered. I would have gone on leading the Liberal Democrats. I think I could have pushed up our number of seats.\"\n\nMatthew Parris, Tory MP turned broadcaster, described the episode as the \"most sensational [scandal] of the parliamentary century, bar the Profumo scandal\".\n\nThorpe's father and maternal grandfather were Conservative MPs, but he became a Liberal because of international blunders by the Tories (he cites Chamberlain's policy of appeasement and later the party's Suez \"adventure\").\n\nThorpe was married to interior decorator Caroline Allpass. Their son Rupert was born in 1969. Caroline Thorpe was killed in a car crash in June 1970. Thorpe married Marion Stein in 1973. A distinguished concert pianist, she died in 2014.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats tweeted the news that the former Liberal leader had died, adding: \"Our thoughts are with his family.\"\n\nLord Steel of Aikwood, who succeeded him as party leader, said: \"He had a genuine sympathy for the underprivileged - whether in his beloved North Devon where his first campaign was for \"mains, drains and a little bit of light\" or in Africa, where he was a resolute fighter against apartheid and became a respected friend of people like President Kaunda of Zambia.\"\n\nNick Clegg, who attended Thorpe's 80th birthday party in 2008, paid tribute to the former Liberal leader. \"Jeremy Thorpe's leadership and resolve were the driving force that continued the Liberal revival that began under Jo Grimond,\" he said. \"Jeremy oversaw some of the party's most famous by-election victories and his involvement with the anti-apartheid movement and the campaign for Britain's membership of the common market were ahead of his time.\n\n\"My thoughts are with Jeremy's family and friends as they try and come to terms with their loss.\"\n\nSir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader, said: \"Jeremy Thorpe's enforced resignation as leader of the Liberal party and his subsequent departure from parliament should not obscure the fact that in his day he was an outstanding parliamentarian with a coruscating wit, and a brilliant campaigner on the stump whose interest and warmth made him a firm favourite with the public.\"", "created_at": 1417734028.615, "updated_at": 1418512133.524801, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417708063163/Jeremy-Thorpe-in-February-012.jpg", "feed_id": 17, "id": 75294, "source_id": 7}], [{"url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663829/s/411e0464/sc/11/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cworld0C20A140Cdec0C0A40Cabu0Edhabi0Estabbing0Esuspect0Earrested/story01.htm", "html": null, "title": "Abu Dhabi stabbing: suspect arrested in murder of American schoolteacher", "text": "The United Arab Emirates' interior minister said police have arrested a suspect in the killing of an American schoolteacher at a shopping mall in the capital, Abu Dhabi.\n\nState news agency WAM said interior minister Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan said on Thursday the suspect also planted a makeshift bomb outside the house of an American doctor.

Don Arden, manager of the Small Faces, hired him in 1965 to replace Jimmy Winston in the band, which changed its name to the Faces in 1969 after Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood joined.\n\nMcLagan, known to friends and fans as \"Mac\", worked with the Rolling Stones after the Faces split in 1975 and was a session musician for artists including Joe Cocker, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nA debut solo album, Troublemaker, was released in 1979, and McLagan continued to make music in his own right with his own group, the Bump Band.\n\nKen Kushnick, his manager, was quoted by US news outlet KXAN as saying: \"He was a beloved friend to so many people and a true rock'n'roll spirit.

The irony is that two other men did the same thing, in the same bands \u2013 Kenney Jones and Ronnie Lane with the Small Faces and the Faces. McLagan was never the starriest operator in those two bands \u2013 in the Small Faces, Steve Marriott, one of the great British R&B singers, was the focus; in the Faces he had Rod Stewart and Ron Wood strutting in front, and Lane stealing the show with his exquisite songwriting \u2013 but he was crucial to the sound of both.\n\nWhen one thinks of McLagan, one thinks of the Hammond B3 organ, and the richness he added to a series of great records: think of what Afterglow by the Small Faces would have sounded like without those magnificent swells. Even on relatively minor pieces, like Three Button Hand Me Down, from the Faces' debut album, First Step, he elevates a generic boogie into something greater than the sum of its parts with those judiciously chosen organ lines.\n\nMcLagan had the same B3 since 1969 \u2013 he called it Betsy \u2013 describing \"her\" as a \"Ferrari compared to what comes out of the factories. It's as loud as fuck. I defy any guitarist to compete.\" But his work wasn't about brute force, which was one reason both the Faces and the Small Faces were able to play so many styles with such mastery.\n\nWith the Small Faces, he could be playful: his line is crucial to the music hall feel of Lazy Sunday; it's not just about the lyrics. He could be a colourist: listen to Itchycoo Park and the way the organ adds the shade to what might be a fairly workaday song without it. He could be soulful, tipping the soul into something more powerful, as on Tin Soldier. And he could be trippy when the song required it, as on Green Circles.\n\nMaybe, though, it was with the Faces that he got the greatest chance to shine \u2013 it's not that his role was more integral, more that he got the single best moment on any Faces song, 30 seconds or so into Stay With Me, when that pellmell opening riff falls away, and McLagan comes in with that tumbledown descending honky tonk line. Ron Wood joins in on guitar, and somehow a song coalesces, seemingly out of boozy chaos: it's wonderful. The rest of the song ain't bad, either.\n\nBut the Faces did subtle, too, especially when Ronnie Lane was writing. Perhaps their best song, Debris \u2013 \"I left you on the debris of the Sunday morning market,\" is one of rock's most evocative opening lines \u2013 is a fabulous group performance, and McLagan's beautiful, lyrical, autumnal playing is a substantial part of that performance.\n\nWhen the Faces folded, McLagan played with scores of greats \u2013 the Stones and Bob Dylan among them \u2013 and it wasn't just because he was a laugh: he was one of the greats. In the late 90s he joined Billy Bragg's band, and could be seen playing for audiences who maybe didn't always recognise who the older bloke behind the organ was. And that also led to McLagan reviving a solo career that had spluttered briefly in the the late 70s and early 80s, with several new records emerging as the new century began. He'd relocated to Austin, Texas, which seemed fitting for someone whose best music, no matter how English, had an American soul behind it.\n\nThis year's album United States saw him playing piano and that marvellous, marvellous organ, and singing about relationships, in a voice that, while hardly Stevie's or Rod's, was characterful and human, full of warmth and hard earned wisdom.

As a result, China will face extreme pressure in providing suitable organs for the estimated 1.5 million people awaiting transplants.\n\nDr. Huang said that so far this year, organs had been collected from 1,500 people who had previously agreed to be donors upon their deaths. That exceeds a total of 1,448 voluntary donors for the previous three years.\n\n\n\nBy comparison, last year in the United States, with a smaller population, 14,256 people donated organs, including 8,268 deceased donors and 5,988 living donors, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDespite the improvements in China, Dr. Huang said, many barriers to progress remain.\n\n\"What can't be denied is that, at present, in addition to traditional thinking in China hampering enthusiasm for organ donations, people are worried about whether organ donations will be fair, equitable and open,\" he said.\n\nThe shortage of available organs has led to a black market for organs, and concerns about wealthy, connected patients jumping to the front of transplant waiting lists.\n\nIn 2009, a state-run newspaper said that prisoners were the source of 65 percent of transplanted organs. That reliance on executed prisoners fueled widespread international criticism that it was unethical, because obtaining the consent of condemned inmates was subject to abuse, and the system could even fuel demand for executions.\n\nMeanwhile, the overall number of executions in China has declined steadily in recent years, leading Dr. Huang to declare two years ago that reliance on prisoners for organs was \"a dead end.\"", "created_at": 1417708832.979, "updated_at": 1418511555.575013, "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/12/05/world/05sino-TRANSPLANT/05sino-TRANSPLANT-blog480.jpg", "feed_id": 21, "id": 75014, "source_id": 9}, {"url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/12/china-end-using-executed-prisoners-organs-201412455835770616.html", "html": "<html><body><div><td id=\"ctl00_cphBody_tdTextContent\" class=\"DetailedSummary\">&#13;\n            &#13;\n                <p>China has said it will stop relying on executed prisoners as the source of transplanting organs, in response to human rights concerns, although uncertainties linger over where a replacement supply will come from, state media reported.</p>&#13;\n<p>China has previously said it would phase out the practice by sometime in early 2015, but state media on Thursday reported January 1 as the first firm date to end the practice, citing the architect of China's transplant system, Huang Jiefu.</p>&#13;\n<p>International human rights activists and domestic critics have long said that standard safeguards were ignored when obtaining organs from prisoners who may have been pressured to donate.</p>&#13;\n<p>However, China has one of the world's lowest levels of organ donation because of ingrained cultural attitudes and a legal requirement that family members give consent before organs are donated, even if a person had expressed a desire to donate.</p>&#13;\n<p>Citing Huang's statement to a seminar on Wednesday, the Southern Metropolitan Daily newspaper said China had a donation rate of 0.6 per 1 million citizens, compared to 37 per 1 million citizens in Spain.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"It can't be denied that at present, apart from the traditional thinking that keeps enthusiasm for organ donation low, people also have concerns as to whether organ donation can be fair, just and transparent,\" Huang was quoted as saying.</p>&#13;\n<p>Huang is a former deputy health minister who now heads the national organ procurement network.

He repeated that again in 2009, when announcing the establishment of a national organ donation network. And finally, in 2012, Dr Huang surfaced in Chinese state media once more with a promise to end all prisoners' donations within a few years.\n\nWhy did it take so long? Thousands of people are on China's transplant waiting list in desperate need of organs, with no clear solution in sight. Attempts to address the need, by encouraging public organ donations, have faltered.\n\nBut many in China believe that bodies should remain intact after death. China's also home to a thriving illegal trade in body parts, making would-be donors nervous they will contribute to a wider problem.\n\nA 2012 poll conducted in the southern city of Guangzhou revealed that 79% of respondents believed organ donation was \"noble\". However, 81% were concerned the donations \"inevitably feed the organ trade.\"\n\nClearly, Chinese health officials have a lot of work to do to change public perceptions.\n\nWith a donation rate of only 0.6 per 1 million people, China has one of the world's lowest levels of organ donation. Dr Huang compared it to Spain, which has a rate of 37 per 1 million.\n\n\"Besides traditional beliefs, one of the major roadblocks to the development of our organ donation industry is that people are concerned that organ donation will be fair, just and transparent,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nDr Huang, who used to be the vice minister for health, had last year pledged to phase out prisoner organ transplants by the end of 2013.\n\nAmnesty International's William Nee told the BBC that halting prisoner organ transplants would be \"a positive step forward in China's human rights record\", although some challenges remain.\n\n\"It will be worth seeing not only how effective a new voluntary organ donation system is, but it will also be crucial that the government becomes fully transparent about the number of people sentenced to death, the number of executions per year, and how the executions are carried out,\" he said.", "created_at": 1417712567.855, "updated_at": 1417712567.855, "image": "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/79500000/jpg/_79500666_84432783.jpg", "feed_id": 16, "id": 75066, "source_id": 6}, {"url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663879/s/411d5ddb/sc/1/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cworld0C20A140Cdec0C0A40Cchina0Estop0Eusing0Eexecuted0Eprisoners0Eorgans0Etransplant0Edemand0Edonations/story01.htm", "html": null, "title": "China to stop using executed prisoners as source of organs for transplant", "text": "China will stop using executed prisoners as a source of organs for transplants from 1 January, the head of the country's organ donation committee has said.\n\nThe move, which has been widely welcomed by human rights groups, will worsen the huge shortfall in organs in the short term. Death row prisoners provided the overwhelming majority of transplanted organs for years, owing to high demand and low donation rates. But in future their organs will only be used if they volunteer to donate and their families approve the decision.\n\nHuang Jiefu, head of the donation committee, told a meeting on Wednesday that almost 40 major transplant centres had already stopped using such organs, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported.\n\nHuang, a former deputy health minister, said in late 2012 that China would end its reliance on organs from executed prisoners within two years.\n\nHe warned this week that as many as 300,000 patients need transplants each year, but that only 10,000 or so receive them. While the number of organ donations was still very low \u2013 1,500 so far this year \u2013 he said that exceeded the amount donated between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\"I believe the situation for organ donation will get better and better,\" Huang added.\n\nDonor shortages are an international problem, but Huang noted that the average organ donation rate was 0.6 per million people in China, compared with 37 per million in Spain.\n\nHe said the low rate reflected not just Chinese cultural beliefs but anxieties about corruption. \"People's concerns over whether organ donation can be carried out in a fair, just and open manner are also an important reason why it has been so hard for the cause to advance,\" he said.\n\nAs part of its transplant reforms, China has set a new national system to allocate organs on the basis of urgency, compatibility and patient need.\n\nMao Qun'an, spokesman for the national nealth and family planning commission, acknowledged this year that ensuring the new system worked as planned would be challenging.\n\nThere have already been concerns voiced about the new system. The state-run People's Daily reported last year that an organ donation coordinator for a local branch of the Red Cross threatened to remove a critically injured patient's breathing apparatus if relatives did not agree to donate his organs if he died.\n\nThis year, Huang told reporters that death row prisoners could still donate organs if they wished \u2013 raising questions about people's ability to truly give informed consent under such circumstances.\n\nDonations will require the agreement of both the prisoner and his or her parents, and will need to take place through the standard registration process used for all donors.\n\nHe Xiaoshun, another member of the committee, told the Guardian he was cautiously optimistic that public attitudes toward donations would shift, but that it would be a long-term process, requiring the central government's influence as well as media coverage.\n\nHe added that although in traditional Chinese culture many people believe bodies must remain intact after death, more than two-thirds of young people expressed positive views on donation.\n\nHe acknowledged that the ban on organs from death row prisoners would mean a longer waiting list, but added that the impact would vary from place to place and that the use of such organs had already fallen. Five years ago, 90% of the organs used in transplant operations were from executed prisoners, while this year it was 40%, he said.\n\nChina is believed to execute more criminals than any other country. But the US-based group Dui Hua, which works on criminal justice issues, says that the death toll has fallen sharply.

One notable omission from the cast list was Stephen Hawking, whose ambition to play a Bond baddie will have to wait a little longer.\n\nReaction on Twitter was generally positive, and mostly pun-based.\n\nWith a few pundits proving their Bond history prowess.\n\nSam Mendes's second turn as director, following the $1bn box office success of 2012's Skyfall, is now due in cinemas on 6 November next year.", "created_at": 1417716015.989, "updated_at": 1418511694.220932, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417693513692/662a17d8-e6b2-49c0-bc4e-d625b4c231e4-2060x1236.jpeg", "feed_id": 17, "id": 75080, "source_id": 7}, {"url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663829/s/411ea010/sc/38/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfilm0Cfilmblog0C20A140Cdec0C0A40Cin0Espectre0Egadgets0Esix0Ethings0Ewe0Elearned0Efrom0Ethe0Ejames0Ebond0Etitle0Eannouncement/story01.htm", "html": null, "title": "In Spectre gadget: six things we learned from the James Bond title announcement", "text": "On Thursday morning, in what might have been the most spectacularly over-hyped 11-minute press conference in the history of the entire world, it was announced that the name of the new James Bond film will be Spectre. One word. Seven letters. An overwhelming sensation of gloomy obligation from all involved. You sense that this didn't happen with Octopussy.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, if you were to look closely enough, you would have been able to glean all manner of important facts about the new film. So here, if the announcement was any indication, is what we can expect to see in Spectre.\n\n\n\nConsidering that alternative titles were rumoured to include Exposures and The Hildebrand Rarity, the fact that the film is called Spectre comes as something of a relief. It's a name steeped in 007 lore, and it appears to set Bond up against the legendary global terrorist organisation of old. Which, frankly, given that some of James Bond's more recent foes have included Rupert Murdoch, Bosnian Hamish Macbeth and a guy who cries blood whenever he throws a tantrum, is no bad thing.\n\n\n\nHowever, is it too late to change what Spectre stands for? After all, Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion actually spells Sefcitrae. So let's make it an acronym that stands for Super Pissy Enemies Can't Trap Robot Elephants instead. Because, come on, James Bond has already out-surfed a space-laser on the bonnet of an invisible car. A couple of robot elephants aren't exactly going to strain anyone's credulity at this point, is it?\n\n\n\nNew arrivals for Spectre include Christoph Waltz and Andrew Scott from Sherlock. Waltz, even though he had a full head of hair in the announcement, will almost definitely play Blofeld. Meanwhile, Scott has been billed as a member of Whitehall staff. That said, he's bound to end up being evil, because Tumblr would probably implode and take the rest of the internet down with it if he didn't.\n\n\n\nAll 007 films feature two girls \u2013 one who Bond immediately has sex with and then dies, and one who Bond eventually has sex with and then probably dies about three seconds after the credits when Bond gets drunk and realises that he actually hates all women. This time, the girls are Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux. It goes without saying that Monica Bellucci will play the first girl, because what could possibly be more disgusting than the thought of James Bond having any sort of meaningful romantic liaison with an age-appropriate woman? Bleurgh.\n\n\n\nAdele's Skyfall was the most successful Bond theme in years precisely because it referenced the film's name in its own title. Therefore, the Spectre theme song should do the same. In fact, assuming that it has the same tune as Skyfall (which it probably will), I've already written the chorus: \"Here comes Spectre/ They'll neglect yer/ They'd like nectar/ If they were birds/ Here comes Spectre/ Wear an eye-protector/ Because they'd peck yer/ If they were birds, but they're not/ They're Spectre\".\n\n\n\nAn alarmingly large portion of the Spectre conference was handed over to the reveal of the new Bond car, which is an Aston Martin of some description. However, only revealing one piece of product placement from the new film seemed like a terrible own-goal, since Bond movies are historically dripping with the stuff. Sam Mendes should have been surrounded by hundreds of cloched plinths, and torn around the soundstage yelling things, like \"Here's the official Spectre phone! It's a Sony Experia Z3!\" and \"In Spectre, James Bond will wear an Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean wristwatch! Hey buddy! I give you good price!\" before dressing up as a giant Heineken bottle and singing a jaunty song about his silky taste, affordable price-points and desirability as an aspirational brand while doing the can-can as energetically as possible at someone from Total Film.\n\n\n\nI hope Sam Mendes and EON don't take this personally, but Thursday's announcement was so short and begrudging that it probably didn't need to happen at all, especially since Alex Zane's introduction to the announcement was about three times longer than the announcement itself. For Bond 25, let's maybe gee things up a bit, like Marvel does with its announcements. Get a room, pack it full of screaming fanboys instead of disinterested members of the press, and wind them up until they pop. Maybe get the cast to abseil onto the stage, or have Daniel Craig combat-roll up and down the aisle pointing his fingers at people like they were guns. Either that or just email everyone the title. That seems like a much more sensible option. And also that way I wouldn't have to liveblog it.\n\n", "created_at": 1417723226.996, "updated_at": 1418511898.096017, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417704155212/1275f562-cb25-401b-8574-6136a2fb8f5e-2060x1236.jpeg", "feed_id": 17, "id": 75171, "source_id": 7}, {"url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663829/s/411ca2dd/sc/38/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cfilm0Cfilmblog0Clive0C20A140Cdec0C0A40Cbond0E240Ewatch0Elive0Estream0Enew0Ecast0Etitle0Eannouncement/story01.htm", "html": null, "title": "The game's bingo, Bond bingo: James Bond movie to be called Spectre", "text": "Right, so, what can we take from that?\n\nSpectre seems like a pretty decent name for the film.\n\nI'd guess that Bellucci will be the Bond girl who gets killed early on because god knows the last thing that any Bond film wants is an age-appropriate love interest for 007.\n\nThere will be a car of some description in the film.\n\nI'm really disappointed about the Dangerminge thing.
